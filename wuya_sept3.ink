Detective Reinaldo Williams
August 12, 2000
 
I found a man swept up on the shore. He ain’t looking so good. His skin is all black and peeling, like a burnt fish in the oven that wasn’t scaled. Lean build, kind of short, a little man.
 
* Was this what my dream was about? []
->thedream

===thedream===
 
I dreamed I was a young boy standing in the sugar cane fields, when my father came back from the Vietnam War.

 He wanted to show me where his great-grandparents came from. His eyes dead, his back all bent, walking with a cane. Father spent the evenings singing to himself all low and sad, sitting on the porch smoking.
 
I remember being small and defiant, not wanting to visit this place where all the horseflies will get into any opening of your body. Mother told me, in the harshest tone imaginable to a child, to spend time with Father.
 
When father brought me there, he left me alone in the car and walked off. Before the war, my brother had died in an accident, and I think that, along with the people my father had killed, had droven him off the surface of this planet. Little ol' me started getting scared, because he left me in the car alone and I didn't know where he went. 
 
So I got out of the car that he left unlocked and I ran into the sugarcane fields thinking he was there. I ran and ran until I got tired and sat on this pile of hay. 

* And I waited. []
->cawing

===cawing===

 Until I heard cawing. Then another and another. I saw above me in the dark sky, a murder of crows.
 
I decided to follow the direction they flew in. Thinking that this would somehow make me less lost. I could've walked to the other side of town at that point. And I know this didn't happen in real life. My father lived with all his regrets and sins until I was a grown man. But I still woke up crying, because I know he wanted to do this and willed all his power not to. 
 
Poor ol' me found my father laying down in a puddle in between a row of sugarcane with a gunshot wound to his head. All those damn crows were knipping at his feet. And then the murder I was following was coming towards his body like a fleet of kamikaze.
 
I woke up. I've had this dream before. I lived among birds. It wasn't fun. 

* So I did a Hail Mary.
->achingknees


===achingknees===

I bend my aching knees down to get a closer look. The body doesn’t have hair, he's not wearing clothes. Oddly, I don’t smell a thing, but I ain’t touching that without gloves. I'm not gonna breathe any deeper.
 
There’s nothing on him that can indicate an origin, at least with just my two eyes, I aint the coroner. It’s midnight and the moon is full. The air chilly and whistling in my ears, as a storm is coming soon. Of all the nights I decided to walk out, this has to happen.
 
* Also, it’s a tuesday night. []
->prologuecallfriend

===prologuecallfriend===
 
 I don’t have a phone or a camera with me, since I thought I was only going to walk on the beach and watch the waves. Ain’t anything here to be taking pictures of. It’s mostly tourist trash. My house is only a couple of blocks away.
 
And now tonight is when I finally regret going out unprepared. I get up, listen to my knees crack under my weight, look around the body to see if maybe something came along with it. But there was nothing except a Cola can buried in the sand.

I decide to call my bud, Manuel, even though I know he will kick my ass later for it.(click-append: "later for it.")[ 
 
"Rei, the fuck you calling me at this time at night. DO YOU SEE WHAT TIME IS IT?"
 
"I found a body at the beach."
 
"A body? What do you mean, man?"
 
Murders do happen on La Isla, but not as often these days, and not in this level of brutality.](click-append: "of brutality.")[ This isnt the 80s or the 50s. But it reminds me of stories my mother told me as a child. 
 
"There's a guy here all burnt up. Some nasty shit."
 
"OK, I'm coming over -"
 
Manuel lives only a couple of minutes away from me. I don't want to call policia because they won't come at this time anyway. [[And I'm retired.->prologuefriendhere]]]

:: prologuefriendhere
Manny comes over in a wifebeater and holey jeans. Looking like back in the day except his head bald like a finial. He looks at the body and then at me, pausing a bit because I know he's wondering why I'm still dressed in detective uniform.(click-append: "detective uniform.")[ (black tie, white button up, black casual pants. Just can't break out of it.)]
 
"Is that it?" He turns on a flashlight and points it at the body. I nod. He puts on his gloves and mask. I really wanted to ask if he was comfortable doing this, but I let him do his thing.
 
"This guy is real messed up." He looks up at me and the lift of his brows begs for more information. I tell him I was just out on a midnight stroll, clearing my mind. I don't tell him about my dream.(click-append: "about my dream.")[
 
"Well we not gonna know anything until we do some testing. Think the killer is smart enough to remove teeth?"
 
"I hope not."
 
"Well we got bones here, got the whole sack with everything in it."
 
"Yep. Do you smell anything?"
 
Manny looks at me like I asked him the most ungodly, asinine ass question.](click-append: "question.")[
 
"Of course, I do. I know you liked to sniff kerosene but I don't." I shake my head. (click-append: "my head.")[( I once admitted I like the smell of oven gas. Back in my young days, I used to work culinary and barbecued a lot. The smell reminds me of that time. But I don't know if that killed my nose hairs, I've always been this way.)]and cursed him under my lips. At least my ears are still good, most of my family went hard of hearing by their 40s.
 
It looks like he called the others, because I see the red and blue lights [[in the distance.->prologueindentity]]]

Was the meaning of that dream, was to tell me someone I know has died? That I have finally rediscovered a distant relative. I pretty much forgot that he existed. The bastard of my father, some kid he made before the Vietnam War with an unknown woman.(click-append: "unknown woman.")[(I'm sure she aint far though, this island isn't that big.)] Who always was tiny and bitching, couldn't stand him as a child myself.
 
Then he became a giant, a riotous bull, but inside, outside he was still muy flaco.(click-append: "muy flaco")[very skinny] And now he is defeated, merely a defeathered hawk caught in a trap and then pulled out and falling apart as a result.
 
Why does everyone in this family, fall to the worst fate orchestrated by this [[man in the sun?->Caseclosed]]

:: Caseclosed
August 14th, 2005
 
That is one case in my life I will never solve. Who killed my cousin? It was closed the minute DNA tests came in and my brother was found to have connections with radicals who blew up a factory. I'm always thinking about it. I want to know who killed the only child of my dear aunt or rather, the only child she could physically touch. As that other one went missing. Went somewhere, police never found him. His body probably festered somewhere up in the mountains.
 
Then his body just  became one with the land. And now this one too. His mother was buried before him. His father too. So I did it. He left one kid and a wife. I handled it all because my mother didn't want anything to do with it.(click-append: "anything to do with it.")[(My mother and his mother didn't get along. Some little beef that happened when we were kids and that's why I forgot all about him. I told her let bygones be bygones. Stubborn woman she is. Some even speculate she's been put under a spell by someone else on the island, probably her friend who wanted my dad. But that's just all bullshit talk to me.)]
 
Even Manuel has told me to shut the fuck up the moment I mention  it. Then he would drive home and not talk to me again for the whole day. I’ve haven’t seen him lately.
 
I keep fixating on it. But I don’t know how to sketch out a map of my cousin’s activities.  To construct a blue print of his past life. Ya can't phone a dead person in the living room, like those medium TV shows try to claim. I never knew him. Now I never will.
 
I decide to drive to our childhood home. The house is all boarded up now and owned by the government. It’s got graffiti all over it  and the boards are molding. But maybe I can try sneaking in.
 
It’s always a bumpy ride up there. We live in the higher parts of the island and so it’s requires that I drive up hills. I’ve only been up there every three years so I worry about falling down into the rainforest.
 
On the way there, with a little drizzle that pecks the windows as droplets fall from the leaves of trees, I notice something pass by real fast. It looked black too.
 
I didn’t hesitate though because I know I got that black dot in the side of one of my eyes(click-append: “of my eyes”)[I got it from a medical procedure. Apparently too much pressure was blown up my ass and blew out a vein.] I sometimes mistake it for something.
 
Just when I was about to make a turn, I see it again. This time I heard, the flapping of wings. It just a bird. It’s not like I never seen a damn bird. But I'm getting concerned. I can't be swerving off on this road. This car is old also, it always has this loud, droning hum, that Miguel jokingly claims he hears across the island when I'm making my way around town. 
 
I know that living near the rural areas, I'm gonna have some birds visiting me. But I have to keep going. Can't let no birds stop me from where I'm going. 
 
The house from afar, looks so small and ramshackle, that it doesn't look like my childhood home. More like an abandoned shed in a ghost town, a relic of once living memories. The windows look so dark, like tunnels to nowhere.
 
The skies are turning orange, the island is cooling down, wind whistles up here quite loud since we're closer to the sky. When I get out of the car, the sound of it shutting down echoes. I walk up the hill, I hear more caws, more flapping. It's like the dream again, except I'm no longer a quivering child. 
 
There is a family of crows perched all over the house, one pecking at the mailbox. The statue of Mary we had, her face worn with age and acid rain. Her small fine nose gone. A hand missing. Her heart torn from her.
 
A crow stands on her head as if wanting to make her fall under its weight. 

I approach the house, they stir. I ignore it and press on. I get up one step on the porch and they all come flying at me. I try turning away and of course I trip and fall on the ground. They are swarming me, pecking at my torso, my hands. 
 
Soon, they will get to my eyes and my ears. Since that's exactly what [[they want.->IntroQuitJob]]

On the way home from the hair salon, My last check got snatched by the wind.

They say my mother was never found. (click-append: "never found")[That her body must've burned up, turned into ashes the moment it happened.

The grounds of Saint Rosa de Lima Academy had this sense of dread that crawled up your spine when you woke in the midst of the witching hours, covered in sweat, your reeling thoughts and heart beat in sync.](click-append: "in sync.")[
 
It was located in the most rural of the barrios. Where you know the conquistador owned their plantations - sugar and blood mixed with the soil - and tainted it with a generational omen of mourning people you don't know.](click-append: "you don’t know.")[
 
I always remember how I would wake in the morning and there would be overseers. They weren’t people - outside the nuns of course - they were crows and they were everywhere. Windowsills, the fields, I've even seen them flying amok in the kitchen.](click-append: "in the kitchen.")[
 
They watched you, taking in every scenario of your life, making sure you never left their view. The skies were rarely blue and the grounds felt dead and cold. Do you ever step into a cornfield at night and listen to the wind, your weight overwhelming the soil, feeling like you can hear the earth sigh, because we've made this place so beautiful but also simultaneously we've treated it with utmost cruelty.

I delete the email. I don't want to deal with Genesis. I've wanted to rid her from the recesses of mind ever since I broke up with her.

"What you mean? I didn't ignore you?"
But then this is a lie, I technically have in a sense. I came to the States to live a new life but we still talked. Briefly Genesis did come here to do a residency. But then she decided to go back and I stayed. When she returned we decided to break up because the relationship just wasn't the same. The wires weren't sparking anymore, is the best way to describe it. 
 
As hella corny as that sounds.(click-append: "as that sounds.")[
 
But what I haven't told her was that after the events. I didn't really feel safe. Rather, I felt that I couldn't trust anyone from that area of the island anymore. My mind decided "Oh you rooted in that part of Saint Paulo? Well guess what? You out of my life now." 
 
And that's what I kind of wanted to do with Genesis. But something in me still wanted to hold on. But something also sensed something very wrong…

"Do you forgive me?"
 
"People get busy and sometimes they forget others. I wouldn't say it's ok but -"

"Genesis, you don't even wanna know what I've been through. Living here is hard. And I wouldn't even say the struggle is satisfying."
 
"Weren't you going to school for psychology?"
 
"No I dropped out."
 
"I also remember you saying you wanted to do physical therapy."
 
"Do you know how many years is that?"
 
She pauses because I know what she's thinking. Why can't you figure out what you wanna do? I can't answer that? I really don't know what the hell to do or what the heck is going on.
 
"So what have you been doing? Playing solitaire?"
 
"Rude."
 
"I'm being real here."
 
"Not everyone is a scientific extradonaire"
 
I feel all the tension of the past and now the present stirring in between us. The beginnings of a tornado.
 
"But science is good to know. You should know what your body's doing. You just want the easy way out."
 
"Ugh, please."
 
"I'm sorry."
 
"I went to a training course and became a hair dresser. I make feel good inside and out. It's almost like psychology."
 
"Lupie, there's no shame in that. I could totally see you doing something like that actually."

"It's not that…I don't want to talk about it or remember. It's just…I haven't talked to you in awhile…And that's the first thing you brought up?"
 
"Okay. I'm sorry, I just…how are you doing?"

"I'm doing fine? I just go out of work and I'm sitting in my car eating lunch. It's raining very hard."
 
That sound like a freaking typhoon not even just heavy rain. 
 
"It always rain a lot in this part. Where we live. It rarely rains and everything is all dry. I wonder why?"
 
"The air so dry you wake up with a bleeding throat."
 
I touch my throat and feel for the windpipe. I squeeze it a little, then swallow to see if there's an obstruction.
 
"And what are you doing?"
 
"Nothing much. Just chilling."
 
I don't even want to talk about getting fired and job searching. It's just so demoralizing.

Dear Guadelupe,
 
I know we haven’t talked in a long time, but I have changed as a person and wish to see you again. I miss you. I miss the sea, the fresh air, the smell of the fields. I left La Isla with you and we went on our own path willingly so it’s not like we separated on bad terms. But I’ve just never been the same. I want it all back. As greedy as that sounds. Not just you or home. But you, home, and the academy. I was very sick, filled with a longing for home while I was in Spain, it almost killed me. So I came back home with the goal to reopen the academy to turn it into a school for disabled children. But of course that will take some time and I managed to at least clean up and remodel some parts of the academy. Then I thought why not tell everyone else? Get our old friends to together. I doubt the teachers or the nuns are alive but. We can invite Fideo, remember him? Adrian? Luz? I remember Fideo the most and he’s still living on La Isla, he was one of the first people I ran into when I got out of  the airport. But anyway this has gotten so long already because I want to say so much to you that I don’t even know where to start. I think it’s because my heart and my mind is still in awe with you and I think if you came back I will cry in your chest. I still love you. I have never wanted to be with anyone else and I only dream of you in my arms. I do all the time, sometimes you have hair and sometimes you don’t. Sometimes you have clothes and sometimes you don’t.
 
I hope no one else sees [[this message.->IntroEmailREChoice]]
Love you,
Génesis

:: IntroEmailREChoice
This is Génesis Juarez alright. Always just like a telenovela. 
 
I don’t have a job and I don’t have any friends because they came with that job. How much is rent this month? At this point I might as well move back to the island.
 
Right now my bank account isn’t so bad. I can buy a ticket and a hotel room for a few days. I can wear my burgundy suit. Do some fresh braids and a fade on my own head. No worries about looking formal. But when I come to the U.S. I have to return to job begging.
 
I need to escape from this land. At least for a bit. At the same time as I move the mouse cursor over to the reply button, there’s this weight on my shoulders, a phantom attempting to forestall this decision.
 
[[I exit out the window->IntroTheEmailExit]]
 
[[I start typing a response->IntroTheEmailResponse]]

:: IntroTheEmailResponse
I start typing a response, my fingers go into a flurry, trying to get out what I need from my heart, before it diminishes because it got overridden with other ailments caused by this day. 
 
There are things I must apologize for, this border between us happened more because of me, my own weaknesses. I’m not going to tell her however, that I became a FORMER hair stylist/braider and that I never went to dental school like I told her.
 
Dear Génesis,
 
First of all, I apologize for my coldness. I softblocked you on Facebook after our breakup. Meaning, I hit block and then unblocked. Then I changed my name. It’s not much different from before. Guadelupe del Rosario became Lupe Santiago. I changed my last name to my mother’s. I also changed a lot in looks too, you won’t recognize me. But to be real, I don’t post shit on Facebook.  Nothing interesting  for you to see there. Except maybe a picture of an ice cream cone I posted. Some books I bought. I’m glad to know everything is going so well, but then I can’t imagine something ever going astray with you. It’s like God just wants you in your place so bad. And about this reunion? I will come. I would like to see you again. Living in the U.S. has brought much luxury to me and being on a new land without any connections is liberating but also exhausting. I would like to know what’s going back on the Island. I want to know what everyone’s up to. But more than anything I want to see you again. I lost all my contacts so I don’t have your number, call me tonight. I want to hear you again.
 
Love,
Lupe
 
Of course, half of this letter is all a lie. I did not lose her number, I deleted it. I’m also currently unemployed and when I first came to this country I spent the first year practically on the verge of being homeless until I begged the River Sister salon to hire me. But you can’t just tell someone who has just arrived into your life for the first time in years that you’ve been misfortunate. 
 
I breathe in deep, I don’t even edit the damn thing and hit send. Then I turn off my laptop so I don’t  spend the aftermath of this decision refreshing my browser and [[take a nap.->IntroTheDreamCrows]](set: $preservation to 2)

:: IntroTheEmailExit
I exit out the email and decide to do something else with my time, maybe apply for more jobs. Research a new career path, find new ways to survive this capitalist state that tells me I need to go back to school to do something I’ve been doing almost a decade. 
 
But then I think. Should I at least go to the reunion? Have Génesis thinking I’m not going to come, and then kick down that door with the widest grin on my face. 
 
This isn’t a romance movie. I don’t have time for parties. As much as I would like to see Génesis again, I don’t feel ready. I log off my laptop and decide to take another nap instead of continuing on with my day.
 
It’s only noon, but the laundry can wait. [[Sleeping is good for you.->IntroTheDreamCrows]](set: $collapse to 1)(set: $noresponse to true)

:: IntroTheDreamCrows
It’s a reoccurring thing for me, this dream. That’s why I wanted to stay far away from Rosa de Lima and La Isla. That’s why I came to the U.S., where I have no commonality with the settlers, to forget all of me, to dispose of every remnant of myself.(click-append: "of myself.")[ But everything always comes back with a vengeance, we constantly try to flee what haunts us in every crevice of our psych and organs, and failure to do so is bound to happen most times.](click-append: "most times.")[
 
I always dream of the last couple of days I spent on Rosa de Lima before going off to university. I’m sitting at my work desk, writing about something that my dream never reveals, despite that I am in the omniscient view. Of course there are crows sitting on the window sill, having conversations that are private to humans. I guess you would have to die to ever know their realm of gossip.]
 
The skies are dark, heavy with gray clouds preparing for a onslaught of rain. It's early in the morning, most likely exam day because I crammed through the night instead of studying intermittently and then would wake up two hours before the alarm. The church bell tolls, echoing through the fields and the halls. Génesis knocks on my door frantically, I turn and open it, complacent in my role, as if it were just like any other day where she came to do [[homework with me->IntroTheDreamCrowsEnd]]

:: IntroTheDreamCrowsEnd
She grabs me by the hand and I hear the sound of struggle and panic filling the environment yet I see no one because I am so focused on where Génesis is taking me.
 
It’s always like this, we leave the school grounds and go into the fields even though it’s against the rules. We flee deeper and deeper into the corn fields, walls of God’s golden fingers, that prick and tickle our eyes and ears, scratch our cheeks, but in the dream I don’t feel this.
 
It like forever until Génesis stops and I will look up as the sun begins to push its way through the clouds. Then I look down and before me is our principal lying dead on a golden bed of corn. Blood flowing out of her head, crows picking at her hair. Her ear in the beak of one. Then I bend down and look into her hole, searching for her soul or her actual brain. 
 
It always ends with me turning to Génesis to say something but [[she is gone.->Chap1EndWakeup]]

<h2>Middleground</h2>
 
(if: $father_news is true)[Tonight I felt someone's presence, but only for a brief moment while I was tossing in my sleep. He wants me to know that he has finally found me. And it was indicated with a vague touch on the bottom of my feet.
 
My mind has been haunted by others -  in my dreams, while I sleep - in the late moonlight hours. This is the first time I have dreamed of and been haunted by my father.(click-append: "haunted by my father.")[It went like this:
 
I'm sitting in a home I've never been in, at a table and on a chair I've never had. The chairs were wooden - lacquer black - the table is decorated with checker board mats. sky blue walls, with white . I didn't even know homes like this could exist, after all I was raised in an underfunded Catholic boarding school.](click-append: "boarding school.")[
 
We're sitting in a sun room and I'm eating cereal. Fungus gnats float in the milk and sweet corn. Banana leaf plants surround us. The air cool and smelling like petrichor - as it just stopped raining - and ripening fruits. There's a little whiff of a rotted one that must've fallen off the tree. I can see outside the windows that surround us, that it is late afternoon, the sun is coming up from the clouds. The sky is a collage of blue, orange, and pink strokes in various lengths. 
 
I haven't seen something like that in awhile. To be in one place where there is no strict order, noise pollution isn't mechanic, and a person who shares my blood sitting across from me.(click-append: "across from me")[
 
All I see are his brown hands, much like mine. In the dream, I remember comparing, how they're the same exact shade, and how we both went through life trials that have scarred our hands. Brown keloids from burns on the surface of the back, calluses on finger pads. The skin of our body is a uniform canvas that portrays the occupations we take on in extensive detail.](click-append: "in extensive detail.")[
 
Nothing really happens in the dream. I am eating cereal with my father on the breakfast table. He is saying nothing, hasn't looked up from that paper at least once. Is it some kind of metaphor about invisible fathers? Guess so. (click-append: "Guess so.")[
 
I woke up covered in sweat. It was 11PM. I cursed under my breathe because to me that feels like a quarter of the day is gone. Another day, more time to lavishly spend determining a new fate.
 
wonder if he's going to come back in the real world, with a phone call. That he will lead me by the hand to some answers for my brand new assortment of questions. I can't stop thinking about the fact that I heard his voice. From somewhere. A place I'm not even aware of. I need to find out what the hell happened [[to my old man.->MyOldMan]]
 
(Elseif: $job is true)[
 
I was called this morning for the job. Not even a week passed after I was offered it. Not even a day. 
 
 It feels like I’m starting life all over again, picking up another mode of production, donning a new uniform. The pay? Ten dollars an hour. Only two dollars less than the constant radial twisting work I had to do at the hair salon.
 
I get up with my hands shaking with anticipation of the new role they’re going to pick up or maybe because of the lack of activity it was used to before, being too idle or my erratic typing. 
 
The restaurant opens at 11PM and I walk into the back of the kitchen where the phone is. I just sit there on that stool, wearing a white apron, black shirt and pants.
 
Other men are there packing food stock, one of them is a humming a dissonant tune that tingles my ear drums.

(if: $leo is 1)[Leo comes into the kitchen. The other chefs turn to him and nod. Is he a respected figure here? He greets me, with the slight wave of a hand and leaves the kitchen again. I do recognize one of the chefs, the older guy that was playing cards at the table, stir frying vegetables. His glasses on the tip of his nose, bridge shining under the light as droplets make their way down.
 
[[I pretend to be very busy->firstdayjobpretend]]
 
[[I say Yo->firstdayjobyo]]]
 
(else:)[I do not know the name of the young guy I saw at the laundromat, but he came to the kitchen a while ago. He did not look me in the face at all. Despite his age, he seems to give off the vibe that he is my boss. He sure isn't a friendly one. I turn away and look at the computer where I also manage the online orders. The CSS/HTML is as minimal as a book page.
 
The stool I sit on has a loose leg and it quivers when I shift the weight from one thigh to the other. The table this computer sits on has numbers and names etched into the wood. Brian. 3947320373. $45.76.
 
It is way too hot in here. This area feels like a closet that had its door ripped off to make way for this set up. I feel like an abandoned storage container  that sometimes sought after for stores necessities.
 
[[I start to question this job->jobroom]]

:: firstdayjobpretend
I pretend to be very busy. I can't read the guy well and I assume that maybe we shouldn't talk casually on the job. There's this tension in my chest though, because my body knows I'm just not that type of person. I turn to look for him again to make up for this moment
 
But he is gone. One of the chefs yells something in his dialect. It's directed at the old man, who glances at me. Pauses and blinks twice, his eyes recollecting who I am. But he doesn't know my name, can't put a label on me. He goes back to work without saying anything to me. 
 
It will take awhile for me to [[assimilate here.->jobroom]]

:: firstdayjobyo
I yell "Yo, what's up?" from my corner, carved into a hole, away from any mutual connection outside pots, pans, and steaming water. He turns to me says "Ay", but I'm just assuming he did by reading his lips, whatever he said buried under the barrage of slamming pots. 
 
At least I tried to be friendly or comradely. Something along those lines. I sit at the desk and stare at all the carvings at the table. Man, do people ever respect [[other people's furniture?->jobroom]]

:: jobroom
The [[phone->jobroomphone]] is on the desk. I have a computer in front of me, it’s on [[sleep mode.->jobroomcomputer]]
 
There is a [[chef->chef]] chopping vegetables. He’s doing rather it rather slowly, without an ounce of worry or urgency about an impatient, hungry mouth.
 
I’m sitting here waiting. It’s too early for people to order food. But yet I am here.
 
 
Note: in order to achieve the climax before you go to the island. Cut scene where Leo talks about hiring you and your plans to burn down the place and move to the island. You planned to burn down the restaurant after business started to die. But as you hired  more people and more ppp began to appreciate the business you decided maybe the place doesn’t need to be burned down after all. But the person who wants to help with the burning hasn’t had much luck and decides to burn down the restaurant against your will to get their business back. Leo apologizes and you for a bit getting to know each other. When he finds out your from the island he realizes imhe will come with you to set up his business there and help out with the reunion since he used to live there and wants to check up on things and how the curse is progressing. He knows that Reinaldo has died and wants to free his spirit

The phone is silent, still on the mantle. Dust in the little holes with number. I don't understand how they still have this thing. I put my finger in one of the holes and turn. The sounds is satisfying to me.
 
 It's a spam call. I hang up. False alarm. I'm getting antsy.
 
More silence. I get bored and put the phone on my ear. I hear the air flowing in and out of the holes. 
 
I hear an interesting conversation. I try to focus on their words.

My father is in a vase now. I can't keep that on my shelf. I know in some parts of the world and for some people of certain religions, this is normal. But not for me. Sitting at my desk on the laptop, messaging Gene who's asking me when I'm coming back, I sometimes feel his hand on my shoulder. The light squeeze he gives me because that's all he can do in that form of his body I guess.
 
This is not resting. I don't want him like this.(click-append: "Like this.")[
 
He is behind me, nodding, smiling in probably the most crooked way because his body cannot not allow it. Happy that his heir to the family name is doing something as mundane as searching for jobs and writing cover letters that only halfway make sense. I know he is restless over the thought of not being able to see me grow old. He has missed a lot. He was stolen from me. But it's not like I could've been able to stop that.
 
 And it's not like he could either. Sometimes I think life is about hurt and missed chances, when I shouldn't. It feels like it sometimes though.(click-append: "though.")[
 
My father was born on Christmas. Which I just found out a couple of days going through the papers that was sent to me by Manuel, who never contacted me again after. He wants to stay far away from any semblance of the past decade. I know he's sitting right now in Na Wen's knipping wonton strips, trying to push back all of those remnants that returned at shore in his mind. 
 
I think I should give something back. I'm sure he's tired of lurking. So I take the vase off my shelf and go to Coney Island. I know he will like that type of thing.(click-append: "type of thing.")[
 
As I'm driving there I feel a flutter in my chest. It started sleeting as soon as I left the house. The skies darken and the road is bumpy on the way there. People driving like chickens with no head who somehow got their claws on a wheel. Is this something Dad doesn't want? I know he doesn't want to be here. Does he?
 
I can feel it in my veins. The coldness that courses through my body every time he's around.(click-append: "he's around")[
 
The boardwalk is crowded, despite the weather and I'm walking on it with the vase in my hand. People are hurrying to go home, their little holiday get together ruined by God's crystalized perspiration.  No one notices me. I listen to the sound of the waves and look up at the sky, letting the blocks of eyes hit the aqueous humor. 
 
I don’t think he wants to go.]

:: ReturnEnd1
I sit on the porch at Gene's house. Listening to the coqui's sing and the occasional squeak from the rocking chair. Floorboards moaning beneath. I got a plate of melon on my lap, my cheeks are red from the steaming shower I just took to clean all of Adrian off of me. 
 
What a fucking story to write to nowhere and no one.(click-append: "no one.")[
 
Gene had went off to fill the fridge before the police comes to ask us questions. Only a melon was on the table for me to eat and I had asked before she went if we could just order pizza. She then reminded me that this isn't the States and I still got this silly smile on my face thinking about this.
 
I have not assimilated to one place. I have been uprooted so many times that I do not have a consistent identity and constantly forget what's beneath my feet. This place is too far from a pizza shop.
 
I want to eat my feelings.](click-append: "my feelings.")[
 
The melon juices satiate my thirst and all I can think about is how much I've lost and what little I've gained. The answers have come to me, but there's nothing I can do to receive benefit. My mother is dead. My father is dead. I have no other family that wants to claim me. Now, all my friends are dead too, I guess.
 
All I have is Genesis. And the missive of truth that I've grabbed off the edge of Adrian's tongue is bound to remain in me for years to come.](click-append: to come.)[
 
I can't tell if it's cowardice or retribution. After what we unburied, how can anyone even make sense of this and keep it deep within?  
 
I stand up and the boards sigh, there's a bible on Gene's chair. I pick it up and the inside is all ink runs and holey pages. I flip some more pages and find a gold chain with a cross. I put it in my pocket.
 
I listen for the sirens. But instead I hear the flapping of the wings of a crow. Just like in my dreams. Just like in the fields. 
They are always watching for me even after I had left them.
 
I can't tell if it's for the better. I cover my eyes with the bible, I stay like that for a good moment.

Adrian is gone. He has already boarded a plane, with the help of Leo, to Hong Kong. I don’t agree with the moral question of this. But in this whole net of hurt and consequences, I don’t even know what is the right resolution or rather, we didn't have the time to pick one. Because regardless, it would end with all us thrown in a ditch.
 
Perhaps, I’m playing foolish. Regardless, I’m only a background prop in all of this.
 
Before Leo left, we talked little over the cafe and pan dulce at Na Wen’s. My glass clinking against the saucer, Leo's habitual slurp he couldn't subdue that time, and the news playing about Fideo's death. All his accomplishments. The town's paying their one sentence respects. He was a nice kid. A hard worker. A good friend. 
 
But not a single one of them shared his blood. I can't help but think I share more in common with Fideo than Genesis. Since I'm not going home till tomorrow, I return to my hotel room. 
 
The TV will remain off. The internet must be disconnected.(click-append: "disconnected.")[ (not like I got anything to do on it anyway.)] I do not want to think about Fideo anymore, I instead sit on an armchair and stare out the window. 
 
The skies are getting dark and heavy with a rain storm. Right now, I like to think it's taking in the death, the souls, and wringing out the impurities when precipitation comes down. The sun purifies the sky as it arrives. 
 
People next door are talking in hushed voices behind me. A gasp of horror or maybe mourning. I put my ear against the wall. I hear the winds of empty space between my body and it, I put my hand against the cold paint to make a better connection. Why am I even doing this? Of course they are talking about him. Everyone is talking about him and they don't even know who this man is. Not in the flesh, not in the words he left to others. 
 
It's turning my stomach. They don't know him, they don't know what he has gone through, but they just want to fill the emptiness they have inside for him.
 
*window bump*
 
I turn to the window, as I've heard something slam against it.(click-append: "against it.")[ (Almost like when some kid throw a football at my condo once.)] I open the window and look out, let the wind and rain wipe my face. My lens dotted with drops. 
 
I hear them, a murder of crows coming toward me. They form a V-shape in the sky, flying in unison, and I can't tell if any of them are sparrows or crows. 
 
Even now till this moment.

I'm sitting at the porch reading the bible Gene left on the table. I'm not a religious type, but then everyone says that. It brings me back to the old days. Remembering the catechism, getting As on every exam of those. Reciting it all in my room in the closet, even sometimes at night in the bathroom, letting my voice get carried out by the wind.(click-append: "by the wind")[We had one big bathroom for each floor. I remember the pink painted stalls for the girls'. Pink chipped paint. The teen girls would throw wet toilet paper to the ceiling and it would stay there. My feet on the cold concrete floors. I think about that now and I get disgusted, probably stunk like hell in there, but kids don't always notice that stuff.](click-append: that stuff.)[
 
I rock on the chair, close my eyes. The porch is old and rickety and Gene walks up the steps and I half expected her to fall through them. She's got that smile I used to see back in college. When

:: SchoolSceneMissing
I was woken up by Gene in the middle of the night. She's dressed in uniform and wearing  a white ribbon as her headband this time. I was covered in sweat from a dream I don't remember now. I had just made 18 when this happened, Gene and I had drunk bottle after bottle of rum to celebrate the new year. Soon the graduation ceremony was to come, we had just finished all our coursework. Our gowns hang on closet doors.
 
I had shaved my head and trimmed a star on the side. Gene had traced it with her finger, touching the naked scalp several times. I can still remember the static and chill of her touch. And now it was heavy, my skin stung from her grasp. Her face stolid, but her eyes intense, piercing. 
 
"Are you awake yet? I called you five times and shook you like a tree. You didn't even move."
 
My head was spinning, my body felt like a weight in the sea.
 
"We're supposed to be in the auditorium. Every one of us. You're gonna get me in trouble."
 
I didn't even wanna argue that she didn't have to save my ass. 
 
"What's going on? Adrian kill Fideo yet?"
 
"The Principal has gone missing."
 
"What you mean?"

She throws a shirt at me and my pants. Gets on the bed and wiped some cut hair off my neck.
 
"She said she was going to visit her mother remember? That was three months ago. A little too long for someone who hates their mother."
 
"Maybe her mother is sick."
 
The bell tolls, it was never rung at night but on that one it did. Thrice for the bad news. We went to the auditorium, sat on metal chairs in the darkness with the light on Father Saul. We pray, he tells us not to be sad, not to forget that just because one is gone, doesn't mean they can't see us from heaven.

:: ReiFlashbackScene1
January 1st, 1994
When my cuz disappeared, his mother was struck with cancer and she didn’t wanna live in that house anymore. She suspected it was cursed. Her firstborn gone. Her husband dead. Now her secondborn son gone missing too. But no one wants to buy this house. Because it's in the middle of ass nowhere. There's birds flying all over. And now it's cold. No one looking for houses now. Not even the islanders who left, made some money, and decided to buy a vacation home here to go sip some sangrias on a porch with their American kids.
 
"It takes awhile for them to trust you.  But if you treat the land right, they will be friendly." says Chino over here, standing on the wet grass in open toe sandals and bermuda shorts, looking at the house with a monocular. A real old one.(click-append: "A real old one."[("Dollond London" I see engraved on it. It's got that greenish color on the metal. Can he even see through it?)] I watch as a red ant crawls in between his toes and he doesn't flinch. Can't remember his name. Something like Lia something. I will ask his name when he leaves.(click-append: "when he leaves.")[(It's not like I'm doing it on purpose. He says it too fast and he lowers his voice to a hoarse whisper. Guy's weird as fuck.)] 
 
What this kid know about birds? I'm starting to regret this but I was told by Manuel to get him here. He does this, I guess I would call it an "inspection" for free? I'm hoping he exterminates them, but that won't sit well with the vegans  these days. So instead I stand on this hill on this bright day, blue skies heavenly without a cloud. The sun burning the shoulders of this "inspector".
 
"So what I gotta do? Give some kind of bird feed? I came to this house the other day and they all came charging at me."
 
"Who is the owner of this house?" He turns and looks up at me,(click-replace: "up at me.")[up at me, (I'm a massive guy. Got it from my father, I'm 6'4. The Chino has to be around 5'3.)] sunglasses reflecting the sunlight, hair from his ponytail let loose by the cool breeze.
 
"Paula Jesus-Williams, my mother. I got all the papers back at my place. Took them all before she passed."
 
"Oh, I'm sorry for your mother."
 
I say nothing as he approaches the house and not a damn  one of those birds moves. He steps onto the porch and one of the boards caves in. I expected the guy to be screaming for my help. But he instead turns and looks at me like I set up a booty trap for him. All the crows started flying away and cawing up a storm. I'm wondering why of all the times I've walked my big self on that step, it breaks now. 
 
"Ay man, you ok?" But he puts up a hand telling me to stop as he tries to lift his leg out. Probably because he's embarrassed. He's bleeding on the ankle, I'm hoping I don't have a lawsuit. 
 
I move one step and one of the birds standing on the hanging flower pot is looking at me, I make another step, and another looks from the roof, getting ready to target. But I'm not scared of no birds. 
 
This time they didn't do a single thing.

:: ReiFlashbackScene2
"You need to study the history of this land." He says. His facial expressions hidden by his sunglasses that he insists on wearing in my dark ass house lit only by one lamp with a yellow light.
 
"What do you mean? I been to school. I know the basics," I say and then realize how utterly idiotic that sounds. Spewing words without turning a single cog for just a moment longer. His lip quivers for a moment, because he's either wondering if I'm drunk or there's a language barrier going on. He takes his sunglasses off, revealing a soft, plum cheeked face. Kid look old enough to be my teenage son.
 
"….What I mean is. Who has lived here before and what has been done here."
 
I got him back at my place, with a band aid on his ankle. A business card(click-append: "business card")[(I wouldn't call it a business card, but its got his phone number and name on it. Leo-insert family name-)] on the table, I've given him some of my possibly expired Maria cookies(click-append: "Maria cookies")[(I didn't go grocery shopping.)]  and a fresh brewed coffee. 
 
I drink coffee, I take a big gulp thinking of what happened here. And I can't think of anything really. All I know is that there's fields of sugar cane here and the houses here could be better but we like it that way. What sugar cane means is slavery and shipping it to American ports. It's a known fact on La Isla of course, but the people who have descended from all this, people who had legislation enforced on them that said you can't bomba or you will get whipped, are thought of as a ghosts in some other parts. After all, on television, they didn't even have people like me on it. They painted blue-eyed Carlos Black skinned.
 
"All I know is that La Isla's waters. Her blood? Tainted forever tainted. Since the White man came by boat."
 
He nods. "But I'm talking about something recent. But I know that forever lingers. But what I'm saying is, whoever's here is protecting you or someone else from something. You might wanna look back in your family tree or the house's past. Perhaps your mother's death has the air here disturbed."
 
I don't like this kind of talk. This has always been a thing here.  But the difference is, they stayed at fields, they never took over the house till my brother was gone…
 
"Oh. I think I know now. We got a lot of family tragedies over here. You remember the case of uh. Gilberto Williams? Well, you weren't even born I'm assuming. They started coming after my first brother was gone."
 
He nods. "Yes, I wasn't here when that happened.  And do you know exactly what happened to Williams?"
 
"We never found him. No. The government never bothered to, because we suspect that the government played a role in it. That's why I became a cop, as traitorous as that may seem, to get closer to the enemy, found out what they're doing on this island."
 
He nods again, but I see a slight smirk. 
 
"Did I say something funny?" 
 
"Nothing…." He gets up, with a slight limp, he makes way for the door. 
 
"Whatever you do, don't make them angry, they're already got their beaks sharp for ya. I suggest you never go near your mother's house again."
 
He leaves. And he doesn't even say "Thank you."

:: theflames1
It's evening. I'm already getting used to the calls and writing up the orders. After all I'm a master of multitasking. I curl your hair, while answering phone calls for appointments and coming up with the most assuring responses for your tales of woe about your husband or boyfriend. This is nothing new to me, it just requires me to sit, something that I took for granted when I had to stand for hours on end, twisting my wrists, and listening to blow dryers.
 
Jonny is sitting on a stool eating an orange as the other chefs leave. I'm still thinking about the cooked sparrow. The taste of it wasn't so bad to be honest, but it just wasn't an animal I could ever imagine eating. I've always thought of birds as a dirty creature. I've eaten blood sausage, chitlins, pig ears, but couldn’t wrap my mind around a sparrow.
 
I'm surprised it's still in my stomach.
 
I start getting ready for closure and begin packing my bag.  The screech of stool indicates Jonny is done. He opens a door and a cool breeze invades the kitchen. Leo is probably out locking the doors. And he says I always have to report to him before I go. So I leave the kitchen and start walking to the back where his [[office is.->theflames2]]

:: theflames2
He's not here again. Why does this man leave his office unlocked? I leave and run right into him. He's dressed in an overcoat on a humid October day.
 
"You leaving?"
 
"Yea man, was clocking in."
 
"In my office?"
 
"You told me to meet here earlier?"
 
"….Oh that's right."
 
"Yes, yes please come in. I had something to tell you."
 
We go into the office. When he closes the door, everything always feels so still. I don't know if it's the location or something with him.
 
"I wanted to tell you that… well obviously you're hired. But since you're so good at what you do, we've decided to put you on the cashier AND the phone. Since Suzy is leaving and that increases your pay blah blah."
 
"Are you doing this because we talked last night or?"
 
"No. I'm doing it because I know you don't want to be up there at the phone booth and Suzy is leaving anyway. She's too old to work here, she said herself."
 
"Fine with me. More money, less problems."
 
"… Isn't it the other way…Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that. I like you. I think you're a great asset for the business."
 
I notice that when Leo talks, he has this slight smirk on his face as if he either performed this before meeting me or he feels that whatever he trying to tell me doesn't fit the situation. Like the guy gives me this vibe that he's really not supposed to be an owner of a restaurant but rather a worker here.
 
"Anything else you wanna tell me?" 
 
"Uh, well you see…I've told you before about this too and I really hope you don't mind."
 
"What did you tell me, I don't remember?"
 
"You see, I have to attend a special event this week. It's something I really can't miss."
 
He seems a bit disappointed…I think? Can't really tell. I know this is kind of unprofessional though, I hate it. But I have to go, I don't want to disappoint Genesis. Such wonderful timing this reunion is. It couldn't be over the summer or even the winter, nah it had to be smack dab in the beginning of a school semester or a… work semester in my case.
 
"I'm not a tyrant or anything. You can go, I'm not going to tell you what to do with your life. No questions asked either."
 
Wow, that was easier than [[I thought.->theflames3]]

:: theflames3
We leave the office together. It feels odd when no one is here. Almost like something is lurking in the corner. Outside, the windows are covered with metal except the front door which Leo closes right now and puts a lock on it. He motions with a key in his hand.
 
"I always forget we live at the same place. So you're going in my direction now right?" 
 
Walking together in the darkness. With another man, feels odd to me. Then I think about how I've walked alone without a single thought of getting knived in the middle of the street. But then I'm used to that. I look up as we walk, it's an eclipse. The moon is brightening the sky more than usual. The sky is clear with no stars, the face of the moon sometimes reminds me of a skull. I've once seen a red moon as a child and thought it was God bearing an evil eye on the planet.
 
I have 2 more days till I leave for La Isla. I hope I come back with a job still and earn enough to buy some little shack at home. It will take awhile, but it's not something I haven't planned out before.
 
"So you're from the Islands right? Saint Paulo?"
 
"Yeah, why what about it?"
 
"I lived there for a brief period of time as an exterminator. There one fact about me."
 
"An exterminator? Exterminating what?"
 
"Crows and sparrows."

The mention of crows turns my stomach slightly. How you go from a bird killer to owning a restaurant. This a rich, Renaissance man?
 
"Everyone does weird jobs before they get to their actual life goal."  
 
"But how did you end up there of all places?"
 
"Chinese do go everywhere. Spanning the globe. East is everywhere."
 
"Yea, I know that but…why to kill birds?"
 
"It's kind of hard to explain, I didn't exactly kill the-"
 
"So you know about the school I used to go to?
 
"What school?"
 
"Rose of Lima, the boarding school that was closed a couple of years ago."
 
"Uh…Nope never heard such a thing."
 
He's lying, I can't tell from the look of his eyes and how quick he dismissed it. He lies just like Genesis used to do. A glint in their eye, looking elsewhere, a crack in their throat. but I ain't going to push any further.
 
"Well, I'm going over there to meet some friends and chosen family."
 
I lied on the chosen family part.
 
"You wanna come?" I'm partially joking on that.
 
"I haven't had the need to go back…I do miss it sometimes."
 
[[Encourage him to come with you->theflames3encouragehim]]
 
[[Change the topic->theflames3change]]
 
[[Just shut up altogether->theflames3shut]]

:: theflames3encouragehim
"I don't know what part you lived in, but there's tons to explore. When's the last time you been there?"
 
"About ten years ago."
 
Wow, how old is this guy, he doesn't look younger than 30.
 
"You got family, kids, a boo?"
 
"Nope."
 
"I've been following on social media, all kinds of stuff is going on. Lot of protests, governors is getting kicked, now they're trying to get the other. Things have been getting worse conditionally, but politically things are getting better for the islands."
 
"I've heard all about it."
 
Now that I think about it. I feel bad I've never gone back earlier. I've been too busy consuming what's here and nothing homegrown. It's not like I could help it. I'm not the only one.
 
"Also, over the years people have been reclaiming their spaces and building their own things. I don't know what you doing with birds over there but I'm sure they need your help."
 
"HAHAHA. Yeah, sure"
 
I don't even know what I'm trying to say, he probably thinks I'm nuts. Childish even. 
 
[[We  finally get home->theflames4]]

:: theflames3change
I change the topic, we're toeing a line here I think. But I don't really have anything to say honestly.
 
"So what games you play?" He asks me suddenly as we turn on a curb.
 
"Games I play….Farmtastic." I don't really play games. I don't even play board ones.
 
"I play a lot of card games with Jonny, my old man. He's getting tired of them though. But he's not interested in trying anything new."
 
"You're asking the wrong guy, sorry man. Only card game I played was 'Go Fish'"
 
"Maybe you should come over and play with us one day. Maybe we need an extra hand."
 
But there was like five guys there?
 
[[We  finally get home->theflames4]]

:: theflames3shut
We shut up altogether and he seems to be walking a little faster as if the quiet has made him anxious. I notice that it's actually a lot cooler than I thought. Hope I don't get sick tomorrow. 
 
"Ay, did you take anything home with you?"
 
"Nah, man. I'm full."
 
I'm kind of lying on that, the sandwich burned up in my stomach long ago and I feel so hollow.
 
"You shouldve taken a little something. Here. I don't really like these anyway."
 
"Oh uh. Thank you? I don't know what this is?"
 
It's lychee flavored gummies. I know what the fruit is but everything else on the wrapper is written in Chinese.
 
[[We  finally get home->theflames4]]

:: theflames4
We finally get home and go on our separate ways. I eat the candy Leo gives me instead of a real meal. Genesis is still texting me on her plans in the group text chat. I've muted it. Sitting on the sofa in my binder and my undies, feeling the cool plastic on my ass cheeks, I fall asleep.
 
But of course, it's a rough one. This time the dream sequence changes a little bit. I am sitting  at my work desk finishing off some homework but Genesis never comes. But the panic is still here and the crows are still surrounding us, taking over the land.
 
But no one comes for me, it is only I who makes the move. I run into the fields and I find no one. It is only me being surrounded, the target. 
 
I don't know what this means. It's probably not [[gonna mean anything.->theflames5]]

:: theflames5
My phone's ringing. I wake up with my mouth feeling all nasty and dry and my sweaty thighs and cheeks make a racket on this sofa as the skin rubs against it.
 
I have five missed calls. Holy shit. It's Leo. You know something bad is happening when you get this many calls. Why didn't he text me? Shit my phone is on vibrate of course.
 
"Ay man, what's up?" I sound almost a bit too panicked right now. 
 
"Someone set the place on fire. The police are here, the ambulance is here."
 
Well no shit, I hear all of that in the background. He's freaking out too, his voice all hoarse. I hear him curse under his breath and yell something out to someone off the scope of my knowledge.
 
"No one is hurt so far at least from what I know. But neighbors had to evacuate. Connected buildings man."
 
"Is…the whole place down?"
 
"No, they managed to get it in time. But no one can work there now. NO ONE."
 
"Are you-"
 
Oh the 'no one isn't directed at me? He's arguing with someone else now and a whole bunch of phone noise and racket starts going on and I take the phone off my ear. Then I hear a thud. He must've dropped it.
 
"Uh, I will call you back," I say. 
 
Now what am I going to do? I will just sleep for now and get those answers when [[the sun comes.->theflames6]]

:: theflames6
Jonny and Leo are sitting at home after a long night with the police. Leo, his head cradled in his hands, face red with anger. Jonny is on the verge of tears. They have not undressed from their work role. The two men are troubled about what's come next
 
"I knew he was gonna do it anyway," Leo says finally, breaking the one hour silence. "He had something up his sleeve."
 
Jonny says nothing, he turns away and turns the TV on. The light always brightens the faces of the long dead people on the wall above. Leo looks up wistfully at the portrait of Qiu Fan.
 
"Why do I continue living? Honestly. Just take me back there again."
 
"Starting things over again?" Jonny asks.
 
"It's not like we can't. But I don't want to rebuild with that guy around. And anyway, we're supposed to keep small, keep invisible. To stay dead in memory, to stay quiet."
 
"I don't have much time here, son. I don't know what you're talking about."
 
Leo has nothing else to say. He is thinking about going back. After all, he has some things to tend to back on the island.  
 
At 6AM, he still hasn't gone to sleep and he opens up the phone book and looks for Reinaldo Williams. He calls. No one picks up. He assumes it's because [[the man is not awake.->theflames7]]

:: theflames7
I'm unemployed again. Can't believe this shit. I'm sitting at my laptop now, looking at jobs. I've got one email for an interview but it's too late now.
 
Leo knows that I'm on hard times. Like yea, I can go to this reunion knowing that I'm gonna return back to this "home" with nothing. The chance that I will be homeless will be looming over. I thanks the God that I'm not an ill person. But I do have to pay for T…for water…food…breathing the air of this building…
 
I don't know what do now and pretty I gotta get on a plane to La Isla. Sitting on my laptop, playing the sounds of some old time salsa singer I don't know the name of but recognize the voice, I contemplate how I'm going to stay. I start house searching and of course the cheapest houses look like you will die in them if you breathe too deeply. Some of them are completely burned and made for the diaspora to come over and fix it. But I'm not one coming home with gold in hand. I'm coming back with…my android phone with a cracked screen that I can no longer download apps on. I at least dress nice?(click-append: "dress nice?")[(I bought most of my streetware off some Asian stores in Chinatown that sold it cheap. I'm tiny and White man's clothes don't fit me, sometimes I grab from the woman's aisle too but I'm not feeling the fabrics.)] 
 
There's nothing I can do except listen to the rain fall now. Laying on my stomach, thinking about how the rain will wet the ashes and charred foundation of the restaurant. Leo had sent me a picture, it's not so bad but it means a couple of days of work lost. 
 
Is this a sign that I shouldn’t [[work there?->theflames8]]

:: theflames8
*phone rings*
 
I close my eyes for just a moment, felt the cold, heavy hand of slumber taking me, to be snatched away from it with a phone call.
 
Sometimes, I regret having a phone. It's a means of survival but also a daily disruption. 
 
I pick up the number without checking if it was a robo call or a familiar human.
 
"Hello?"
 
I get up from the sofa, with the phone on my ear. Pain pulses through my body as it hasn't adjusted to my new job yet. My ass cheeks isn't used to sitting on a hard wood chair for so many hours.
 
I stretch my legs as he explains to me over the phone what has happened.
 
"That's uh…pretty fucked up. So a nearby store owner burned your place down?"
 
"Guy I've had a long time conflict with. Guess it was finally time for him to end it with a…blast.”
 
“I uh would hope it don’t end with a blast.”
 
“You know what I mean.”
 
I’ve had a crazy three days. I don't even want to know what's coming next.
 
"Do you have any free time where we could meet up?"
 
"I don't know man, I got some preparing to do for the event. I gotta be there tomorrow. I’m spending today packing my bags.”
 
“I thought about what you said yesterday. I’m going back.”
 
“You’re just gonna drop everything and go back? What about uh. Your….g-grandpa?”
 
“Jonny is not my grandpa…Anyway yes I am going back to Saint Paulo. I have a home there still. Its rented out to a friend whom I seem to have lost contact with.”
 
That’s some smooth responsibility you got there. Also, I'm betting dollars that your friend is flaking on you, but I'm not gonna say that to him.
 
"So I'm returning more to check on some things more than anything else."
 
"Fine, like. Why are you even telling me this? You wanna come with me?"
 
"….No, I will just see you on the way there, that's all. You sure you don't have any free time?"
 
"Maybe  sometime at noon. At the muffin place what you think?"
 
"Anywhere, anytime that's fine with you."
 
"It's final then."
 
I hear him say "Okay, that's good, that's good," and suddenly hangs up on me. He's got a bad habit of doing that. 
 
Now, I have to call up Genesis, I promised to call her the day before [[I go.->genesisimcoming1]]

:: genesisimcoming1
After getting dressed and eating an egg, I sit down in black skinny jeans and baggy band shirt, (click-append: "baggy band shirt,")[I'm probably gonna spend a portion of this day picking out outfits.)] I call Genesis. One dial tone, two dial tone. Surrounded by a luggage and an air mattress, my savings sprawled out on my table after I broke the jar.(click-append: "broke the jar.")[I don't trust that nearby Spaniard bank. Who ever heard of that one?)] 
 
"Hello? Lupe?"
 
Wind distortion again, I don't understand why the connection so damn shitty.
 
"Hey, what's up babe? I'm calling like I promised."
 
"And you always keep the promise." She laughs and shivers go down my spine. (click-append: "down my spine.")[(I can never describe it. It's not loud but not quiet either. It's sounds raspy because she was a colic baby.)] It's the same one she's always done. Not that a person could change that much in that sense. I think. I wonder what she looks like now.
 
"When are you coming over and where will we meet up?"
 
 I recall on our graduation, her braids were all the way to her hips and that they swayed as she walked down the aisle. Her face shaped like the moon and her deep dark eyes shined under the sun.
 
"I bought the first ticket available online, I'm probably going to arrive in the early evening."
 
(if: $hotel is true)["You got hotel? A lot of them are super expensive."](elseif: $house is true)[I think I told her already that I was taking a hotel. I managed to find a super cheap one. It will probably be shitty for sure, but ay it's only one night and I've had way worse. I will be bring her plenty of stories to the island.]
 
"You've missed so much since you left the island. Of course most of it is up there in New insert town name. But even our home has changed."
 
"For the worse or for the better?"
 
"….I would say both."
 
With that being said, we both fell silent because I know the former 
  is most true.
 
"Forgot about it me, how are you doing?"
 
"Oh, I don’t even wanna talk about it. Just a lot. A lot.”
 
She sure sounds exhausted for sur. Her voice went from a beam of brilliance to a dim light far far down a tunnel.
 
“It’s been my dream to do this. But it’s a lot of work. But I know it will make things better….I can’t wait to see you, Lupe.”
 
“Y-Yeah me too. Me too…” The last me too comes down from my lips in a whisper and I don’t even think it reached Genesis. It almost doesn’t sound genuine, the tone of it sounds like I forced it. But in reality when she said that I felt my voice trapped in the back of my voice and I had to will it free.
 
"I'm gonna let you go, Okay.” 
 
I try saying goodbye but I stutter like a fool until she cuts the invisible line between us. 
 
I resume packing and try not to let the mind fill me up with thoughts of [[what to come.->Leomuffinshop]]

:: Leomuffinshop
I come to the muffin shop and it's serene as hell. No one is here because what person sits down for muffins at 4PM? Leo's sitting in the back near the window with sunglasses on again. But ay this time the sun is shining on him.(click-append: "shining on him.")[I've always loved the time of the day when the sky colors started to swirl together and puts all kinds of hues into the blue sky. It's a nice day today. I wouldn't even wear sunglasses, but he's obviously doing it for a reason. He's even got a cute pair on, they're rounded with a pink tint to the lenses. Guy dresses like he fell into a time warp sometimes.)]
 
"Ay, man, how you doing?" He seems starled at first when I say that. Did I do it too loud? Bet he was expecting I wasn’t gonna come. Also, I notice that when I greet him with the flick of my chin, he also has no idea how to react.(click-append: "how to react.")[It's something I learned at the salon honestly. It's a thing here mostly.)] 
"Sorry, last place used to work at I talked loud because blowdryers, TV, kind of hard to get out the habit now."
"I see…" He pours some sugar in his coffee. This guy used two other packs of sucralose sugar.
 
"Dude, that's not how you drink coffee. Also that stuff taste like poison."
 
I sit at the table with him and decide to order nothing. One of the people working there is wiping a counter, looks at us like we're the oddest pair to appear and keeps working. 
 
"I wanted to talk a little more about why I'm returning to the island. And you're not gonna believe what I just found out."
 
He sighs and pinches between his glabella. Looks pretty bad.
 
"So my friend was found dead in the house for two weeks and so of course, since I'm the owner of the house I have to go back and answer some questions."
 
"Shit, sorry man. T-that's tragic."
 
One disaster after another for this guy. I should be his support system…But I've only know this guy for a week. What am I even doing? I'm getting to close to him.
 
[[Ay, like I don't know what else to say. Can't help you here.->leomuffinshopcanthelp]]
 
[[Do you need me for anything? Why are you telling me this?->leomuffinshipwhyyou]]

:: leomuffinshopcanthelp
"Ay, like I don't what else to say. Can't help you here. This is getting a little too…personal for me. Like you're just a bro that owns a restaurant."
I keep and start making my way out of here. 
 
"Wait let me explain! You're not even listening to me."
 
"I gotta go. I have other things to do and it can't wait."
 
That's lie of course, I got everything packed up and ready to go. I ain't taking the whole condo with me, I just gotta rest my back and go to sleep. There's nothing to do anyway.
 
I leave and I turn back one more time after I cross the street. He's looks pretty distraught about it and is talking on the phone to assume Jonny. 
 
Like, I literally don't need to be wrapped into this? I go home and try to sleep hopefully with no additional symbology in my dream. But luckily. [[I don't even sleep at all.->Chapter2]]

:: leomuffinshipwhyyou
"So why are you telling me this? You just know me the other day. I'm a stranger to you man. You're like the King of Oversharing."
 
"Well, I'm gonna explain that in a moment."
 
"So, do you Reinaldo Williams?"
 
"I don't know any Reinaldo or any Williams."
 
"Do you know he's your cousin?"
 
"Bro, I just sa-"
 
"Do you know anything about your father?"
 
The mention of "Father" makes me pause for a long time. I don't how long but I know long enough that the girl working here has turned, noticing that the convo flow has been disrupted.(click-append: "been disrupted.")[(Sadly, people are gonna listen in regardless, but she will forget this convo two days later hopefully.)]
 
"I haven't seen my father since the day I was born. My mother died when I was young."
 
"That's unfortunate. And I'm sorry that happened to you."
 
"Is there a reason why you know so much about my family tree?"
 
"I've known Reinaldo Williams, who is related to your father, a cousin of his."
 
"He ain't carrying the last name. My father got aunts?"
 
"I don't know about that. But I do know he has a brother who disappeared and then he did too and he remains was finally found  20 years ago. Back in 2000. He was missing for about five years after you were born."
 
"Saint Paulo got a lot of crime, you know. It's always been that way. Especially in that part I grew up in? Forget about it. If you ain't worried about driving off a mountain, you gotta be worried about the next Jeffrey Dahmer. So what you gotta do with the Williams?"
 
"I inspected your aunt's house because…it's surrounded by crows and I know it sounds crazy but -"
 
"EH EH. I know all about it. You don't gotta tell me. I've grown up around them, I don't like to hear about them."
 
"You lived in the house?"
 
"No, that's shits all over that part of Saint Paulo. It's a thing there I don't know. It wasn't always like that, we had some crows here and there because it's god damn rural over there. But I went to a school for orphans. And they were always flying around there. Hoardes of them."
 
"Interesting.."

"I want to why it's interesting to you, you live there."
 
"Not that long though. I came during the….."
 
Does this guy not remember his birthday?
 
"The 80s after that big hurricane struck the States."
 
"Yes?"
 
"I was in the urban areas with Jonny, who owned a restaurant there. Chinese-Latin."
 
"Oh that sounds nice, where is it?"
 
"…It's not open anymore. After it closed I made a living doing house inspection in that area where the crows where. My parents were Chinese peasants and they had an odd fascination with crows. It's a long story."
 
"So. Okay. Now what about this guy at your house. What's this got to do with all of this."
 
"It's a little related. My friend had connections with Reinaldo Williams. Turns out he was a neighbor. And the police know I had talked to Williams for a bit, who was found dead a few months after I had inspected his aunt's house."
 
"Alright. But why does that have to make you a suspect?"
 
"They're probably wondering why I've moved to so many different places. I come from China. Then to Saint Paulo, and then here. There's not that many Chinese living in Saint Paulo. Many of them went to Saint Maria where there's more money and more urbanization."
 
"People gotta follow the business. It's silly to make you a suspect for that."

"Also, I know the dead guy, I know multiple dead guys. But I haven't touched a single soul. All I've ever done was make food and eat. Nothing else."
 
"So, I guess we're sitting together on the plane?"
 
"You don't have to."
 
"Well I wanna know more about my family since you apparently so much about them."
 
"I don't know as much as you think. I only Reinaldo and all the missing fragments of family. That's all. I don't know names or locations."
 
Sigh. So much information to take in. I need a coffee now. Decaff. "
 
We drink coffee and it's gotten darker now. We've been talking for a long time. 
 
When we part ways all I can think of is my father now. I don't know what he looks like. It's bad Leo doesn't know his name. 
 
I go to bed but I don't even know [[if I sleep.->Chapter2]]

:: leomuffinshopouttro
"You're not coming with me? What happened to wanting warm weather?"
 
"Changed my mind. I don't see why I should. You're young, I'm old. My bones aren't going to get any stronger. I can't take planes back and forth my whole life. I will stay and watch over this apartment. I promise everything will be fine."
 
"But what if I don't come back?"
 
"Why wouldn't you?"
 
"I don't know, I just have a feeling I won't."
 
"Don't think about that. You've been here this long, I don't see why the gods would decide now of all times to finally take you."
 
"I'm not too confident. It's a cruel world we live in."
 
The pair are sitting in the dark with the TV show on. The light being the only thing illuminating their faces. Looking like a father and son, despite sharing no blood. Many years ago they were friends, when Jonny with a heart heavy with loneliness and loss, took in a young man feeling the blood curdling screams of his friends and family. 
 
But during this time, Leo wasn't Leo and he had arrived on the doorstep in a torn dress and makeup strewn down his face, as if he had rubbed his cheeks in coal powder.
 
"How is this any different than before? Only difference back then was the country and the language.
 
"I'm uncertain of it this time. There are governmental officials possibly looking after me."
 
"Again, how is this any different. You've fled the homeland for much similar reasons."
 
"….You're right. Wish you would say it.. Better though."
 
"Are you ready for the plane?"
 
"Yes, I've gotten everything ready as soon as the place burned down."
 
"That kid was never arrested? No?"
 
"Of course not. He told a lie and we're partially at fault anyway. We didn't leave when we were supposed to."
 
"Someone needs you there. That's why all these things keep happening."
 
"Maybe you're right. I don't like how it's going but maybe you're right."
 
"Go to sleep, son. You're gonna need a lot of it."
 
Leo packs his bags and spends the whole night planning what's to come. But he just isn't where sure to do with all this wreckage that [[he will leave behind->Chapter2]]

:: Chapter2


:: thegroupchat1
I log onto Facebook for a cursory glance. There's literally nothing on this site that entertains me, not even in the slightest. I've got like 50 notifications.

Prank videos by White jocks that usually consist of pouring beverages on the floor with Jamaican blow horns as an anthem.

Articles about the latest new government debacle.

I just now unfriended a girl I knew in college that decided she's against trans women being in the same bathroom as her.

I missed 10 birthdays of people I don't know anymore.

But then I noticed a new feature. On the bottom corner of my screen I see 50+ red notifications. I've been invited to a group chat and didn't know all these months. Must've forgotten in the whole fugue of getting paid 15 dollars an hour to manipulate hair and exchanging that pay rate to the rising rent.

The last message was a two weeks old and is from Fideo Iglesias, which literally just says: "I got a slurpee at the super market and spilled it all over my feet. RIP." and a laugh emoji response pinned on [[the message by Genesis.->thegroupchat2]]

<!-- (put this part in the middle of all the routes. All routes must have equal length interactions with Genesis and all friends and you must decide if you're gonna be in a hotel or not. If you are jobless, you may spend time in the hotel exploring, if you stay in Genesis you're going to explore her room to discover her hidden secrets. All before you end up in the house. The reunion is going to happen during the weekend and you have a few days before you get there.  Research how buying tickets first. Characters uses all their savings.) You get to learn about Adrian and Fideo in this chat. You find out a third member, Tina, is dead recently and find out the chat went quiet.)-->

:: thegroupchat2
I scroll back all the way. The chat is mostly Fideo and Matias exchanging messages about how they were doing with life and about their jobs.

Matias: "Sup. Got a day off today. Using my sick days for once. 😏"

*Posts a picture of himself at the cafe*

Fideo: "Prankster keeps coming in and putting books with the binding facing towards the shelf and not the consumer.

*Posts a picture of himself rolling his eyes and all the books' pages facing the camera.*

Genesis: LOOOOL

Since Genesis is at the island I'm assuming she's all caught up with them. But Fideo and Matias, I never heard about them ever leaving. 

Never thought they would. 

Childhood frenemies and Genesis and I were always caught in the middle of it. She gonna regret doing this. I can already feel the tension, the homoerotic desire to impress each other. They're gonna wrestle and wipe the cake and drinks off the table.

I hope not. But there's a chance of it. That's if Matias [[doesn't start it.->thegroupchat3]]

:: thegroupchat3
I click on Fideo's profile and he's got a woman in his relationship status and pictures of them exchanging kisses. He's opened a book store in Florida called...La Casa de Anais. Wearing a long pony tail, vest, and sunglasses in one picture, holding a book up like he serving it to you.(click-append: "to you")[He's always been kind of a show off, but he's not a bad person just insecure.]His beard well trimmed, carved so fine it reminds me of pristine curvatures of a mural done by an artist.(click-append: "by an artist")[(I really envious of his beard right now holy shit.]

Matias is single still got a profile picture of himself in football gear back when we were all seniors and our school won their first game on the island. His once bowl shaped hair is cropped,(click-append: "cropped")[the widow's peak makes his moon shaped face resemble a barn owl. His dark, doe eyes doesn't make this comparison any less true.] The muscle he had has softened and gone into his stomach. His arms were still fairly toned. He's gotten tanner over the years. Looks like he's a life guard and teaching swimming in the New San Octavio. 

He's the guy who holds onto the past a lot. With clenching hands that turn red as life tries to pull it from him.

They seem better off [[than me->thegroupchat4]]

:: thegroupchat4
Genesis: "So when you guys got the invitation, did it arrive in good condition?"

Matias: "Yea."

Fideo: "Yeah, why ask?"

Genesis: "I realized I sent the dented one to Lupe. So now I'm paranoid they're all messed up. 😓"

Fideo: "Ay you added Lupe to the group right?"

Genesis: "Yeah."

Matias: "They haven't said anything."

Genesis: "Yeah, I don't know maybe they don't use Facebook very much."

Matias: "Probably muted and forgot."

Fideo: "Always been very forgetful."

Genesis: "Have you guys managed to contact Tania? I can't get through to her and she hasn't replied about the invitation."

Tania...I don't remember that person? I sort through some memories trying to pick up someone who's named started with a T. To be real, I tend to forget people's names. I remember my first week at the job I forgot my bosses' name and I kept trying to steer the convo with questions where she would mention [[her own name.->thegroupchat5]]



:: thegroupchat5
Fideo: "God, I haven't seen her in awhile."

Matias: "Nah, I don't remember a Tania. You guys should know, not me."

Fideo: "You know who she is. She was in the art class with us and drew Jesus and all the nuns started claiming she was chosen by lord christ like they never seen realist art before."

Matias: "Nope, don't recall."

Fideo: "Stop fucking around you were there."

Matias: "Don't remember a single thing. All I remember was that we had Saint Michael in that room, the one where he's penetrating the snake. No wait. I remember you guys mentioning her and I sat with y'all one time and Gene introduced me to a Black girl with long braids."

Fideo: "Oh right. You weren't in art with us. I had art in a different classroom."

Genesis: "We had ceramics together, Fideo. Mrs. Soto did ceramics and art fundamentals."

Matias: "Yea, remember. I never took another art class again after Mrs. Soto roasted me in the middle of class because I couldn't use a compass. WHEN SHE GAVE ME THE BROKEN COMPASS."

Fideo: "OOOOOH."

I don't know who Tania is, can't recall her at all and well I took mostly writing classes [[and the sciences.->thegroupchat6]]

:: thegroupchat6
Genesis: "Didn't she go to Italy?"

Matias: "You should know. 🙄"

Genesis: "I don't know so shut up, Mat." 

Matias is still his annoying self. This goes back to 8th grade. 

Fideo: "Last time I talked to her, she was working at the Pmart where I was buying lottery tickets. She say she was gonna go overseas for a degree, but not Italy I think."

Genesis: "Did you see her again after? 👀"

Fideo: "It was like a year after graduation before I went to college at the States."

Matias: "Y'all, why don't you just look up her facebook profile or visit her. 🙄 We all lived in the same town except Lupe and you can't track down the one friend and classmate who didn't leave the island right away besides me?"

Genesis: "I've tried. Can't find her."

Fideo: "Don't ask me, this site is incomprehensible after the update. All this new shit but Fuckerton can't even make it functional. 😤"

Matias: "Where does she live? Like what street? Can you locate her on fucking, idk, Map Quest?"

Genesis: "I don't know her address."

Matias: "If you don't know where she lives you must've not been good friends."

Genesis: Matias, just because I don't know someone's address doesn't mean a friendship isn't real omg.

Fideo: Yea like, you don't need to know what color toilet someone has in their house to be a friend. By the way, Matias has a pink one.

The chat goes quiet for two days and then [[the saga continues.->thegroupchat7]]

:: thegroupchat7
Genesis: "So, I found her parents on Facebook since her last name was Mohammed and that last name isn't that common here, I managed to find her family."

Fideo: "Yea, she said her father was half Trinidadian or something."

Genesis: "And her parents seem okay, but I don't see anything on her."

Matias: "Sigh, you still looking for her. Maybe she doesn't wanna be found."

Fideo: "Shut up Matias."

Genesis: "I'm scared, I hope nothing happened to her. She has never responded to a single call, email or anything. Even after we graduated. 😔"

Matias: "😢"

Genesis: "I'm gonna message her mom."

Fideo: "Hope she acccepts your request. 😕"

*3 days later*

Genesis: "So, I've talked to her mom. You're not gonna believe this.

Fideo: "Oh no."

Genesis: "She died last year and no one in all of Saint Rose of Lima said anything?"

Matias: "Holy fuck."

Fideo: "😥"

Genesis: I'm heart broken. I cried all night.

Fideo: "Did they say why?"

Man, I didn't think this would get so intense, just thought the girl didn't [[wanna be friends.->thegroupchat8]]

:: thegroupchat9
I keep scrolling down and finally make it to the more recent messages:

Matias: "Ay, my boss pranked me and I fell into the pool. And well. I hope I don't get fired cuz I cursed him out."

Fideo: "Bro, why, it was just a prank?"

Matias: "Well the dumbfuck pushed me on the shallow side, I would've gotten paralyzed. He fucking deserved it."

Fideo: "Oh. Sorry man."

Matias: "How are things going for you?"

Fideo: "It's ok. My girlfriend is kind of a... hate to say it...a bitch?"

Matias: "What did she do?"

Fideo: "I don't know she's just been really mad at me lately."

Matias: "Maybe you're doing something wrong."

Fideo: "What do you mean? I've ran this bookstore more than she has. She practically gave it to me."

Matias: "I don't know man, I'm not a relationshop counselor. I just know how to swim."

Fideo: "I think I'm gonna come back next year, I'm tired of living here."

Me, too Fideo, me [[fucking too.->thegroupchatchoice1]]

:: thegroupchat8
Matias: "You know, things getting bad lately here. See stuff on the news all the time."

Genesis: "The police doesn't want to say, they claim. They never found who did it. She did go to Italy after graduation, she had to work a little bit before, and went there for only a year. She got tired of it and left and then went back to working at the store."

Fideo: "I was gone by then."

Genesis: "They said she was driving at night, it was raining, and she was going home after working over time. Then a driver hit her. And she died because she was struck on her side. Somehow the driver survived and they never caught him. But rumor was spreading that so many people have seen the car since it was a delivery truck and had a logo of a business." 

Matias: Man...

Fideo: omg... 

Genesis: And of course no one has gotten arrested. I feel terrible. I never got a chance to say bye.

*Two heart emojis reacts*

Fideo: "I"m lost for words honestly."

The chat goes silent for about two weeks and in September they try chatting like it's normal. But Genesis rarely says anything. But life seems to have moved on, while a woman I barely know will linger in my memory, passing [[the sorrow onto me.->thegroupchat9]]

:: thegroupchatchoice1
Welp. I got time on my hands. Might as well start chatting now. It's going to be awkward though, I literally just totally ignored this chat...But then I also got my invitation tossed too, so basically I've just been the friend that totally went out of orbit.

The friend that just disappears without a warning. How should I start this.

[[LOL at Fideo's picture.->thegroupchatlol]]

[[Hey, I muted the chat and forgot lol.->thegroupchatmuted]]
<!-- By the way this convo doesnt happen if you work bc you're busy working so when you go to work, you find this convo out on the island and hang with matias and fideo for a day but bc you didnt chat with them on fb the meeting is kind of cold. -->


:: thegroupchatlol
Lupe: "Lol, those look like new shoes too."

My first message since being placed in this group is a "Lol", just try to be casual.

Fideo: "Hey, what's up? How's everything going? You just like ghosted us."

Matias: "Tbh, you could be dead and I wouldn't know."

Genesis: "🙄"

[[I decide to be honest and say why.->thegroupchatlolhonest]]

[[I say I'm just a lurker.->thegroupchatlurker]]

:: thegroupchatmuted
Lupe: "Ay y'all. Okay, I read through the whole chat, I must've muted the chat on a sleepy night after work and just forgot to turn it off."

Fideo: "Yo, Lupe, it's no problem, I hate this website anyway."

Matias: "I wouldn't be here if I was you too."

Lupe: "Oh, that's cool."

Fideo: "Sound like you working hard. You graduated?"

Lupe: "I've been working at a hair salon and I've dropped out."

Fideo: "😧"

Matias: "I'm surprised to hear that, you were a gold cord."

Genesis: "I'm shocked too, Lupe. What happened?"

Lupe: "Not much, I just didn't want to do it anymore. But...I've been reconsidering it again and gathering everything back."

Genesis: "That's great, lemme know if you need help, I can send some of my books. They're just gathering dust. 😉"

*posts a picture of her shelf.*

Matias: "Dear fucking lord."

Genesis: "Please take them. 😘"

I want to be stable [[in this chat.->thegroupchatchoicemid]]and literally never let anyone know that I'm actually the least successful person here.

:: thegroupchatlolhonest
Lupe: "Long story short, so basically I muted the chat during some hard times. I don't really use facebook and my mail box got raided.'

Genesis: "I had to email them about it. lol."

Fideo: "Oh, okay, shit happens."

Matias: "What's been happening in NY 🤔. Thought you makes lot of money as a nurse there."

....Did Genesis tell them I went to PT school and because Matias got hit in the head by a basketball a few times he thinks PT is nursing school?

Lupe: "I'm not a nurse..."

[[Tell them I'm a hair dresser.->thegroupchatloldresser]]

[[Change the topic->thegroupchatlolsway]]

:: thegroupchatlurker
Lupe: "Oh, I've just been lurking. Not really a chat person."

Fideo: "Huh. Maybe we should voice chat."

Matias: "Not much going on here to be honest."

You sure about that Matias? Y'all literally went from discussing gum on your shoe to a dead girl in our year book. 

Lupe: "Yeah, guess would voice chat, do some catch up. Cuz, I don't really like texting."

This is such an old people excuse for not being in a chat group talking to people who have grown up with you. 

Matis: "So you like. busy? Lifting people up or something?"

Lupe: "What do you mean?"

Fideo: "Isn't that like a chiropractor?"

Genesis: "They said they were going to do physical therapy."

Lupe: "Oh that? Lol? Sort of?"

[[Tell them I'm a hair dresser.->thegroupchatloldresser]]

[[Change the topic->thegroupchatlolsway]]

:: thegroupchatloldresser
Lupe: "I'm a hair dresser. I got hired up at Sister Glam and cut and braid hair."

Fideo: "Oh nice, you seemed like the type lol."

Matias: "😯"

Genesis: "Hi, Lupe! You never told me this."

I don't feel like telling her I dropped out but to be real, I probably should go back, really should...

Lupe: "Yea, I'm just making money just to go to school you know."

Matias: "Same."

Fideo: "I just drink lots of coffee and talk about books all the time best job ever."

Matias: "He's lying, he literally only read what was assigned in class." 

*Fideo reacts with an angry emoji at Matias*

[[How you all doing, where we meeting up?->thegroupchatchoicemid]]

:: thegroupchatlolsway
Lupe: "Lol, I'm on the path to doing my physical therapy masters."

Straight up lying to impress Genesis god dammit. I'm literally too embarrassed to admit I dropped out. There's nothing wrong with being a hair stylist. There's a lot of honor in it, to me. I've never learned how to care for my hair and my ancestors braided their hair and held the ocean, the sun...even rice apparently.

I'm just disappointed in the recent downfall.

Fideo: "Oh, congratulations."

Matias: "You've always been a smarty pants."

Genesis: "💖"

Lupe: "Lol. Yeaaa."
